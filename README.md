# Crontab Assignment 

  Create 1 python file that pulls down data from an API and then create 3 cron jobs for that python API based on the following parameters: 
  
- One should pull down data from an API once a day (donâ€™t care about what time) 
'47 22 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/corinne/crontab/crontab.py > log.txt 2>&1 &'
- One should pull down data every Sunday night at 10:00pm 
'0 22 * * 7(SUN) /usr/bin/python3 /home/corinne/crontab/crontab.py'
- And another one (?) should pull down data at the end of every quarter 
'59 23 21 */3 * /usr/bin/python3 /home/corinne/crontab/crontab.py'
